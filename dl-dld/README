This is dl-dld, a dynamic linking interface, version 1.1.

Dl-dld is a re-implementation of the high-level *interface* of Jack
Jansen's "dl" dynamic loading package, on top of the *implementation*
of Wilson Ho's (GNU) dynamic loading package "dld" (version 3.2.3).

This makes it possible to write programs with simple dynamic loading
requirements (just load a module and call a function from it; no
unloading facilities) to run without source changes (using the dl
interface) on a larger number of platforms: using the original dl on
SGI MIPS machines (Irix 4.0), and using dl-dld on DEC VAX (Ultrix),
Sun 3 (SunOS 3.4 and 4.0), Sparc (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix)
and Atari ST.

Version 1.1 adds the function dl_loadmod_mult(), which was added to dl,
and fixes a tiny memory leak -- thanks to Martin-D. Lacasse for this
contribution.

To build dl-dld, edit the DLD path definition in the Makefile and type
make.

To use dl-dld, you must link with both ./libdl.a and (...)/libdld.a.
You must also avoid sing shared libraries, as dld doesn't (yet)
understand them.  This is a price you have to pay to use dynamic
loading.  On SunOS, this boils down to linking with -Bstatic unless
you use gcc, since gcc also doesn't understand shared libraries.

Of course, the low-level interface of Jack's dl package is not
implemented in dl-dld.

(If you don't know where to get dld, try anonymous ftp to
wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors2/gnu/dld-3.2.3.tar.Z.  Jack's dld can be
found at ftp.cwi.nl:/pub/dl-<version>.tar.Z, where <version> is
currently 1.5.)
