Subject: dl-dld 1.1 (dynamic loading interface)

Archive-name: dl-dld/part01
Submitted-by: Guido.van.Rossum@cwi.nl
Version: 1.1

Almost a year ago I posted version 1.0 of this little library, which
mimics the interface of Jack Jansen's "dl" package (dynamic loading
for the SGI) on top of Wilson Ho's (GNU) dynamic loading package
"dld", version 3.2.3 (dynamic loading for several other systems).

Version 1.1 adds two features that are new in Jack's dl:
dl_setmessage() and dl_loadlod_mult().  I'd like to thank Martin-D.
Lacasse for the latter contribution.

(If you don't know where to get dld, try anonymous ftp to
wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors2/gnu/dld-3.2.3.tar.Z.  Jack's dld can be
found at ftp.cwi.nl:/pub/dl-1.5.tar.Z.)
