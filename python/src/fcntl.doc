Module fcntl
============

fcntl(fd, op, arg):
	fd is a file descriptor
	op is an opcode (see fcntl(2) and <fcntl.h>)
	if arg is a string:
		it is a binary struct passed as argument,
		e.g. created by struct.pack();
		it is copied to a buffer whose address is passed
		to the real fcntl call;
		the contents of the buffer after a successful call
		is returned from the Python function
	if arg is an int:
		it is passed as the fcntl argument;
		the return value from the real fcntl is
		returned from the Python function
	if arg is missing:
		it is treated as the int value 0.

ioctl(fd, op, arg):
	fd is a file descriptor
	op is an opcode (see <sys/ioctl.h> and various other places)
	arg is treated as for fcntl
