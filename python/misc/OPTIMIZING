Ideas for optimizations.

The parser should use an arena-style allocator.  It may be necessary
to change to linked-allocation for children.  (I have high hopes for
this one!)

Extracting string items (s[i]) can be implemented differently: keep an
array of 256 objects indexed by character.  (Also do this for
newstringobject()?  Other string ops?  How about special-casing '' as
well?)

Using dictinsert with getstringvalue(v) as key is silly; the
dictinsert function creates an object to hold the string which is
deleted again if the key already exists (the normal case).

Also dictinsert is almost always used in conjunction with dictremove.
Better to have a single function that does both -- this saves code in
the caller.
