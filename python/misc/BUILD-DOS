Building Python on MS-DOS
-------------------------

I don't really know how to do this -- the MS-DOS port was done by Mark
Anacker <dsinet!marka@quick.com>.

Mark used TurboC; I don't know how much of this applies to MSC.

There is no STDWIN for MS-DOS yet.

Since MS-DOS truncates filenames to 8 + 3 characters, many source
filenames are truncated.  For TurboC, it was necessary to change
all #include statements in the source files to use the truncated
filename, e.g., #include "allobjects.h" becomes #include "allobjec.h".
This would be trivial with a Python script, but that has an obvious
drawback... you haven't built Python yet.  A UNIX shell script would
also be easy, but not everybody receives these sources on UNIX (or do
they?).  So for now, just use the editor...

The file posixmodule.c is usable on MS-DOS (it contains #ifdef MSDOS
where necessary to disable some functions).  However I have been
adding UNIX functions so you may have to comment out more stuff that
isn't supported under MS-DOS.
