Ftp availability of Python
--------------------------

The compressed tar image of Python is available by anonymous ftp on
the following sites; the filename will be "python<version>.tar.Z",
where <version> is something like "0.9.8":

Site			IP address 		Directory

ftp.cwi.nl		192.16.184.180		/pub/python
wuarchive.wustl.edu	128.252.135.4		/pub

(The version on wuarchive is likely to evaporate some time after it is
installed; I will try to make sure that the version on ftp.cwi.nl is
always there.)

The following files are alwo available from the same locations:
MacPython<version>.hqx is a binhex'ed Macintosh binary;
python<version>.zip is a ZIPped PC binary; pythondoc-ps<version>.tar.Z
is a compressed tar file containing PostScript of the main Python
documentation (since not everybody has installed TeX and LaTeX);
dl.tar.Z and dl-dld.tar.Z are dynamic loading packages;
maclibunix.shar contains some files needed by the Mac port.

If you are using STDWIN with Python (my Standard Window interface,
highly recommended if you are using X11 or a Mac), you should fetch
STDWIN as well.  The filename is "stdwin<version>.tar.Z" in the same
locations as the Python distribution (but /pub/stdwin instead of
/pub/python on ftp.cwi.nl); <version> is currently 0.9.7.  Python
0.9.7 needs STDWIN 0.9.7, previous versions will cause undefined
symbols at link time.

Please don't ask me to mail you the files.  Here's a hint (originally
from the sci.space FAQ) on what you might do if you have no Internet
ftp access:

|   Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP directly, but
|   there are a few automated FTP servers which operate via email.
|   Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
|   or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you
|   instructions on how to make requests.

Make sure to turn on binary mode in ftp when fetching the file.  Use
uncompress to decompress the .Z file.  Use tar to unpack the .tar file
resulting from decompression.  Please don't mail me for help, try
finding a local ftp or UNIX guru!
