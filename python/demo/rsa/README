This directory contains a complete RSA public-key cryptosystem
developed in Python.  NO GUARANTEES!

This system requires that your Python interpreter is configured with
the modules mpz and md5 (which in turn depend on the GNU MP library).

For an idea of what the system can do, *read* the file rsademo.py (it
comtains ample comments) and then run it: "python rsademo.py".  It
will produce no output if all goes well.

Read the other files in this directory (some are also well commented)
to find out more about the implementation.
