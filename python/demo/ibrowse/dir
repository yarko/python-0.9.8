This is the file .../ibrowse/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Ibrowse you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.  (This is a copy of the Info
dir node, except that the reference to Info is replaced by one to Ibrowse.)

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. 
  Typing "d" returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" 
  gives a primer for first-timers, "mTexinfo<Return>" visits Texinfo topic,
  etc.
