PR
==

write a real manual for wwww in html

Other Projects
==============

Convert Python tut and ref as well

Use html in CMIF (triggered by filename extension) to allow multifont
text (then what to do with the font and size attributes?  ignore?  use
to change the style sheet?)

CERN's WWW
==========

CERN's WWW breaks for 2nd (or relative?) ftp access, endless sequence
of "-1 read" when tracing (on the SGI)

Software Engineering
====================

Use dbm for places instead of marshal.load/dump

Move fmt.py and *lib.py (at least) to lib-python, fix gopher example
in demo/sockets

Factor out more commonalities between www.py and wwww.py (e.g. command
line parsing); maybe even make a base class with the commonalities
between WWWWindow and WWWCmd?

texi2html.py
============

Generate quotes around attributes?

Use <typewriter>?

wwww.py
=======

middle mouse should offer to fetch the referenced document without
displaying it, e.g. to print it if it is plaintext

Generalize next/prev/up/down/traverse to apply to non-texinfo nodes,
and change them not to fill up the history (up should behave like
back, next/prev should leave history unchanged)

Mouse state handling is a mess

Split command menu in a navigation menu and a "special actions" menu

Order various types of functions in the class differently, e.g.:
(1) init/close
(2) stdwin event dispatching
(3) key_<char> functions
(4) msg_<name> functions
(5) high-level semantic functions (follow, search, ...)
(6) support functions (make_*_menu etc.)

Find, goto and save should use modeless dialogs or at least support cut/paste?

If a referenced document is already shown in another window, pop it?

Improve help?

Keyboard browsing (at least space/backspace)?

Add tab command to search for the next link in the text?

Make it into a full HTML editor

www.py
======

Add info browsing commands like in wwww.py

Improve help

When backing up to (!) a search result (e.g. after following a link in
the search result), don't repeat the search but show previous results

wwwutil.py
==========

(none)

htmllib.py
==========

Blank lines in all literal text disappear

Ignore text inside <COMMENT>...</COMMENT> tags

Implement <DIR> listing to format multiple items per line

Change space-skipping to same as CERN's www!  (Ignore newlines at
start of paragraph, but don't ignore spaces -- necessary for new
texinfo example style...)

sgmllib.py
==========

Allow spaces around '=' in attributes.

Allow single quotes around attribute values?

Allow quoted attributes containing spaces.

Expand entity references in attribute values.

fmt.py, Para.py
===============

Break lines only where stretch > 0

Reimplement Para and BaseFormatter in C (they're worth it!)

wwwlib.py
=========

File format directory listings should somehow return a flag indicating
that GOTO should be interpreted relative to the full path, not to the
parent (e.g. modify the address to end in a /)

Boundary cases of ftp pathnames aren't always treated correctly
(e.g. 'file://ftp.cwi.nl' seems to go wrong, should list '/'?).

Support more address formats (especially wais; telnet??? news???)
