Thanks for your interest in a hobby project of mine!  As (I hope) was
clear from the announcement, my conversion program is written in
Python, an object-oriented programming language that I developed for
my own use (but which is gaining popularity all over the world, and
freely available, and even being supported).

Here is the source for the Python program that I use.  You need a
(minimal) Python interpreter to run it; that, you can fetch by
anonymous ftp from ftp.cwi.nl [192.16.184.180], directory pub, files
python0.9.6.tar.Z (source), pythondoc-ps0.9.6.tar.Z (PostScript of the
documentation).  (Files with [pP]ython0.9.7 in their name are part of
the beta release of version 0.9.7 -- fetch at your own risk.)  I hope
you're familiar with building large C programs under UNIX, otherwise
you'll need more hand-holding building Python than I can provide...

Cheers,
