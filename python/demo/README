This directory contains various demonstrations of what you can do with
Python.  Most demos are grouped sub(sub*)directories according to
required optional built-in modules or specific platform; there is also
a set of generally useful scripts and there are some more-or-less
complete applications.

classes		Some examples of how to use classes.

ibrowse		An Emacs info file browser (uses stdwin).
		See also ../doc (the Python library documentation can
		be converted to info format).

md5test		Test program for the optional md5 module.

rpc		A set of classes for building clients and servers for
		Sun RPC.

rsa		An RSA public-key cryptosystem (needs mpz and md5).

scripts		Some useful Python scripts that I put in my bin
		directory.  No optional built-in modules needed.

sockets		Examples for the new built-in module 'socket'.

sgi		Demos that only run on Silicon Graphics machines.
		These require at least one of the optional built-in
		modules that only make sense for the SGI, such as
		'gl', 'al', and 'sv'.  Split in subdirectories
		per subject.

stdwin		Demos that use the STDWIN library.  Require the 'stdwin'
		built-in module.

threads		Demos that use the 'thread' module.  (Currently these
		only run on SGIs, but this may change in the future.)

www		Browsers for CERN's distributed hypertext system
		World-Wide Web (one with a stdwin-based user
		interface, one for dumb ttys).  Also contains a
		primitive gopher client and an ftp client.
		See also ../doc (the Python library documentation can
		be converted to WWW's "HTML" format).

WARNING: many scripts are executable and have a first line saying

	#! /usr/local/bin/python

This is unlikely to give good results unless you've really installed
the latest version python there.  Edit the first line before
installing such scripts; to try them out, you can just say "python
foo.py" or enter python interactively and say "import foo".
