This directory contains the Python distribution and related files.

Python is a portable extensible interpreted object-oriented
programming language with a friendly syntax.  Python is somewhat
similar to Perl and Tcl, but has a nicer syntax, is object-oriented,
and better suited for writing large programs.  For an introduction to
the language, fetch the Postscript documentation and print the
tutorial (the file tut.ps).
